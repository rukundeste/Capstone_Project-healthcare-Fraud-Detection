Hello everyone!!!!

Welcome to my Capstone project: Healthcare Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a fraud detection system for healthcare claims using machine learning (ML) techniques. The goal is to identify fraudulent activities in healthcare claims based on patterns and data from historical claims. The system automates fraud detection, improving efficiency and reducing costs compared to manual methods.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset includes a variety of features, such as patient demographics, medical conditions, reimbursement amounts, and claim details. Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features for optimal model performance.

Feature Engineering: Some claim related features were created and others (features with high null values, features from which other features were created) were dropped.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Datasets were analyzed and visualized to uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and summarize key insights before applying machine learning models. 

Modeling Techniques: Several machine learning models are applied, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. These models are compared based on their performance in detecting fraud.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Hyperparameter tuning is performed using techniques like Grid Search to optimize the performance of the models and improve their predictive accuracy.

Evaluation Metrics: Key performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC are used to evaluate the model performance, with visualizations including ROC curves and confusion matrices to assess the models' effectiveness.

Fraud Detection Pipeline: A robust pipeline is created that includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. This pipeline can be extended to work with real-time data for operational use.
Technologies and Tools Used:
Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM, Matplotlib, Yellowbrick

Machine Learning: Supervised learning techniques for classification, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and ensemble models.

Model Evaluation: GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, ConfusionMatrixDisplay for performance visualization, and metrics like precision, recall, and ROC-AUC for model comparison.
Objectives:

	Identify  fraudulent activities in healthcare claims and transactions. This helps reduce financial losses, improve efficiency and ensure ethical medical practices.

	Develop predictive models and evaluate model performance

	Build machine learning models to classify providers as fraudulent or non-fraudulent based on claim patterns. Assess models using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score and ROC_AUC to ensure reliable fraud detection

This project showcases the application of machine learning in a real-world problem, leveraging advanced modeling techniques to enhance fraud detection in the healthcare industry.
